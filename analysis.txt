Algorithm Analysis
Sorting Dog Objects by name in Alphabetical Order

Algorithms:	Insertion Sort	         Merge Sort          	Sequential Search     	Binary Search
25 Objects	1.243304 milliseconds	0.044663 milliseconds	0.115625 milliseconds	0.103505 milliseconds
50 Objects	1.274772 milliseconds	0.078906 milliseconds	0.037179 milliseconds	0.138632 milliseconds
500 Objects	10.99097 milliseconds	1.136378 milliseconds	0.051576 milliseconds	0.095531 milliseconds

Analysis of the different search and sort algorithms:
The insertion sort method is very slow, around 3-10 times slower than the merge sort. The times for the insertion sort varied a lot as well, with the largest time I found for 500 objects being at 50ms.
The Merge sort method is O(n log n) time complexity, with it increasing only slightly when increasing the number of objects it has to sort
The sequential search had a similar time to the binary search, with both not experiencing time changes as the number of elements increased.
